# MathCorpus-AATA (Thomas W. Judson)

### Abstract Algebra Corpus

This directory is dedicated to collecting corpora from the book [*Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications*](https://github.com/twjudson/aata) by Thomas W. Judson. The full text (2022 edition) is available in [PDF format](http://abstract.pugetsound.edu/download.html) and can be accessed under a license through [Thomas W. Judson's GitHub repository](https://github.com/twjudson/aata).

Two other books from the Open Textbook Initiative of the American Institute of Mathematics are available in this NLP processed fashion: [Abstract Algebra](https://github.com/andreago9/MathCorpus-AATA) by Judson and [Discrete Mathematics](https://github.com/andreago9/DMLevin/blob/main/README.md) by Levin.

These corpora are gathered at the request of [Valeria de Paiva](https://vcvpaiva.github.io/) for use in experiments aimed at extracting mathematical concepts for the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/), in accordance with the **Job Description** below.


**Note**: Using spaCy in Python, this process extracts the relevant statistics and CoNLL-style features.

### Job description:

After collecting a book, the student should make a GitHub repo and then use `spacy’ (https://spacy.io/) (or a similar off-the-shelf tool) to process it, producing stats (the script for the stats is from https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/tools/blob/master/udlib.pm . It’s called conllu-stats.pl), like was done for the nLab in https://github.com/ToposInstitute/nlab-corpus and for an updated nLab in  https://github.com/ToposInstitute/nLab2024-corpus. A nice, short  (4 min) tutorial on spacy is presented in https://medium.com/@pankaj_pandey/harnessing-the-power-of-spacy-a-comprehensive-guide-to-natural-language-processing-ffa6b1e6ff44.

A description of a similar project, building up corpora and benchmarks for mathematical text can be seen in the project [Mathscope](http://www.jacobcollard.com/mathoscope/) (Parmesan was renamed) of Collard and de Paiva, which is particularly concerned with Category Theory. The project has one example of a book [“Basic Category Theory”](https://thorsonlinguistics.github.io/bct/#p1), by Tom Leinster, processed this way and can be found here: https://github.com/ToposInstitute/CT-corpus/blob/main/bct.conll. 
As an illustration sentence 33 of the book looks like the following:

#sent_id = 33

#text = In subjects such as number theory and combinatorics, some questions are simple to state but extremely hard to answer.

We want statistics of the corpus, done for each book, so we can create a (somewhat) verified big corpus of mathematical texts.
